               <p> Sickle cell disease <b>SCD</b> also known as <em>Sickle Cell Anemia</em> is a genetic red blood cell disorder
                and sickle cell warriors often experience episodes of pain and fatigue.
                The key to a normal life with SCD lies in proper management which includes everything from
                proper nutrition, to the type of environment and adequate exercise.</p>
               <P> When it comes to proper nutrition, getting a balanced diet of all food groups is essential. From
                carbohydrates to proteins, fats,oils, vitamins as well as minerals. Today we choose to focus on
                those important minerals every SCD patient should take.</P>
                <ol>
                    <li>CALCIUM<br />
                        Calcium is an <u>essential</u> mineral that is necessary for everyday living. <blockquote>Calcium helps to build
                        strong bones and teeth and helps the body to carry out many important functions. Calcium is
                        used to help blood vessels move blood throughout the body which makes a deficiency in
                        calcium very dangerous to SCD patients and can lead to osteoporosis and Osteomalacia.</blockquote>
                       <P> Calcium in our bodies is mainly in our bones and teeth and since the body cannot produce its
                        own calcium, it is important to get it from other sources.</P>

                        SOURCES OF CALCIUM<br />
                        Dairy products such as milk, yogurt and cheese are high in calcium. Green leafy vegetables
                        such as Brussels sprouts, collards, kale and legumes like chickpeas and other beans are high in
                        absorbable calcium. Fruits high in calcium include Oranges, Grapes, Tangerines, Pears and
                        Papaya.
                        It is possible to get direct amounts through your diet but if you can't get it, consider taking
                        supplements as prescribed by your doctor.<br />
                        SIDE EFFECTS<br />
                        Taking calcium supplements in excess can increase the incidence of constipation, severe
                        diarrhea and abdominal pains. It could also cause kidney stones.</li>

                        <li>POTASSIUM<br />
                            Potassium is an <u>essential</u> macro mineral and an electrolyte. It helps the muscles work including
                            the muscles that control the heart and our breathing. It helps regulate blood pressure, helps with
                            digestion, nerve impulses and helps balance the pH of the body.
                            <p>Consuming too little potassium can lead to serious health issues but too much can also cause
                            severe health problems.</p>
                            SOURCES OF POTASSIUM<br />
                            As potassium cannot be produced naturally in the body, it must be gotten from the right balance
                            of potassium rich foods, which include fruits such as apricots, bananas, kiwis and pineapples. 
                            <p>Vegetables like carrots and potatoes,
                            nuts, beans, whole grains and lean meats are excellent sources of potassium. Adequate
                            potassium can be gotten from foods but for people with low potassium levels, your doctor can
                            prescribe a supplement.</p>
                            Side Effects<br />
                            Since the body is unable to metabolize excess potassium, it is removed by the kidneys.
                            However if the kidneys become unable to remove the excess potassium, it leads to
                            Hyperkalemia. Symptoms include, heart palpitations, chest pains and shortness of breath.
